\begin{itemize}
\item I thought I used the same parameters but \alert{I'm getting different
results!}
\item The new student wants to compare with \alert{the method I proposed last
year}
\item My advisor asked me whether I took care of setting this or this but
I can't remember
\item The damned fourth reviewer asked for a major revision and wants me
to \alert{change figure 3} :(
\item \alert{Which code} and \alert{which data set} did I use to generate this figure?
\item It \alert{worked yesterday}!
\item 6 months later: \alert{why} did I do that?

\begin{frame}[label=sec-1-0-2]{Frustration as a Reviewer }
This may be an interesting contribution but:
\begin{itemize}
\item This \alert{average value} must hide something
\item As usual, there is no \alert{confidence interval}, I wonder about the
variability and whether the difference is \alert{significant} or not
\item That can't be true, I'm sure they \alert{removed some points}
\item Why is this graph in \alert{logscale}? How would it look like otherwise?
\item The authors decided to show only a \alert{subset of the data}. I wonder
what the rest looks like
\item There is no label/legend/\ldots{} What is the \alert{meaning of this graph}?
If only I could access the generation script

\subsection{An IMRAD Report }
\label{sec-3-1}
\begin{frame}[label=sec-3-1-1]{Structure}
Research articles are often structured in this basic order:
\begin{description}
\item[{Introduction}] Why was the study undertaken? What was the research
question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of
the research?
\item[{Methods}] When, where, and how was the study done? What
materials/hardware were used? How was it configured?
\item[{Results}] What answer was found to the research question; what did
the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true? \alert{Present
useful results in a synthetic way with a logical order}.
\item[{Discussion}] What might the answer imply and why does it matter?
How does it fit in with what other researchers have
found? What are the possible bias and points to
improve? What are the perspectives for future
research?
\end{description}

Such structure \alert{facilitates literature review} and is a very effective
way to convey information.

If the report is a few pages long then \alert{an abstract is required}.
\end{frame}
\subsection{Good Practice for Setting up a Laboratory Notebook}
\label{sec-3-2}
\begin{frame}[label=sec-3-2-1]{Step 0: Taking Notes}
\alert{Document} your:
\begin{itemize}
\item \alert{Hypotheses}: keep track of your ideas/line of thoughts
\item \alert{Experiments}: details on how and why an experiment was run, including
failed or ambiguous attempts.
\item \alert{Initial analysis or interpretation} of these experiments: was the
outcome conform to the expectation or not? does it (in)validate the
hypothesis?
\item \alert{Organization}: keep track of things to do/fix/test/improve
\end{itemize}

\alert{Structure}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item General information about the document and organization \alert{conventions}
(e.g., directory structure, notebook structure, experimental result
storing mechanism, \ldots{})
\item Documentation of \alert{commonly used commands} and of how to set up
experiments (e.g., git cloning, environment deployment, connection
to machines, compiling scripts)
\item Experiment results can be either structured \alert{by dates} ($\leadsto$ add
tags) or \alert{by experiment campaigns} ($\leadsto$ add date/time)
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[label=sec-3-2-2]{Which format should I use ?}
\begin{itemize}
\item \alert{Wikis} are encouraged to favor collaboration but I do not find them
really effective
\item \alert{Blogging} systems are also a way of managing such notebook but they
should rather be considered as an effective way to share information
with others
\item I recommend to use basic \alert{plain-text} format and to \alert{structure it
hierarchically}
\begin{center}
Here is a \alert{\href{http://starpu-simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/misc/LabBook.html\#sec-8-1}{link}} to an excerpt of the journal of one of my PhD
student, managed with git/org-mode. More detailed links are given in
slide~\ref{orglabref}.
\end{center}
\end{itemize}

Last but not least:
\begin{center}
Provide links to \alert{Raw Data}!!!
\end{center}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[label=sec-3-2-3]{When/How Often Should I Use it?}
I have a very intense usage (demo to \alert{\href{file:///Users/jvincent/org/journal.org}{general journal}} and specific
\alert{\href{file:///Users/jvincent/Work/Documents/Articles/2013/2013_boinc_response_time_optimization/journal.org}{BOINC journal}}) and I tend to capture a lot of information but you do
not have to be as extreme as I am. Here are a few advices:

\begin{itemize}
\item Spending \alert{more than an hour without} at least \alert{writing} what you're
working on \alert{is not right}\ldots{}
\begin{itemize}
\item \alert{Take a 5 minutes} break and ask yourself what you're doing, what is
keeping you busy and where all this is leading you
\end{itemize}
\item While working on something, you will often notice/think about
something you should fix/improve but you just don't want to do it
now. Take 20 seconds to write a \alert{TODO} entry.
\item There are moments where you have to \alert{wait for something} (compiling,
deployment, \ldots{}). It is generally the perfect time for improving
your notes (e.g., detail the steps to accomplish a TODO entry).
\item \alert{By the end of the day}: daily (and weekly) \alert{review!}
\begin{itemize}
\item Update your lists, write what the next steps are
\item \alert{Summarize in a 2-4 lines} (for your advisor) what you did, what was
difficult, what you learnt.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}[label=sec-3-2-4]{Step 1: Sharing Code and Data}
\begin{overlayarea}{\linewidth}{7.6cm}\null\vspace{-.6cm}
\begin{block}{What kinds of systems are available?}
\begin{itemize}
\item "Good" - The cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, \alert{Figshare})
\item \alert{Better} - Version control systems (SVN, \alert{Git} and Mercurial)
\item "Best" - Version control systems on the cloud (GitHub, Bitbucket)
\end{itemize}

Depends on the level of privacy you expect but you probably already
know these tools. 
\hfill\textbf{\bf Few handle GB files}...\hfill\null
\end{block}\begin{block}{Is this enough?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use a workflow that \alert{documents both data and process}
\item Use the machine readable \alert{CSV format}
\item Provide \alert{raw} data and \alert{meta} data, not just statistical outputs
\item \alert{Never} do data manipulation and statistical tests \alert{by hand}
\item \alert{Use R}, Python or another free software to read and process raw
data (\alert{ideally} to \alert{produce complete reports} with code, results
and prose)
\end{enumerate}

My favorite tool.
\begin{itemize}
\item plain text, very smooth, works both for html, pdf, \ldots{}
\item allows to combine all my favorite languages even with sessions
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Ipython notebook}
If you are a python user, go for it! Web app, easy to use/setup\ldots{}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{KnitR (a.k.a. Sweave)}
For non-emacs users and as a first step toward \emph{reproducible papers}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Click and play with a modern IDE (e.g., Rstudio)
\end{itemize}
